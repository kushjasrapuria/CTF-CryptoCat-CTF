# Writeup

Navigating the webpage http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/.

There were two options Choose Red and Choose Blue.

Intercepting both requests with Burpsuite.

The Choose Red was a GET request.

```

Both request didn't had any data which could be modified but something was off why there was two different type of request used when it could be done from only one request type.

I searched internet for different types of requests.

```
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
PATCH
HEAD
OPTIONS
TRACE
CONNECT
```

Out of all of these i tried modifying GET request and replacing GET header with HEAD.

```
HEAD /index.php? HTTP/1.1
